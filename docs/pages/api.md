# API

The graph API can be used to programmatically interact with a graph you have instantiated. You can control the view of the graph using the translate / scale functions as well as create / delete / update graph nodes and edges. The full API is documented [here](https://api.playcanvas.com/modules/PCUIGraph.html).
